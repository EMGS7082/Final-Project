**MINI-DUNGEON**
 
**STATUS-** We are mostly lost, but we managed to at least give everying a sprite and hitbox. We expanded the map and mad it so that doors work (without animation).    
**SCHEDULE-**  I'm not really sure where to go from here, and that's because I'm hitting a major roadblock every time I try to do a new part without your help.    
**ROADBLOCKS-** I have no idea how to make items fall on the ground and how to pick them up, how an inventory would work, how to format combat and have healthbar present in the top left with precentage of the bar filled based off of a number. Basically we don't know how to code.
